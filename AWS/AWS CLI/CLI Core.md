The AWS CLI acts as a wrapper around the AWS Query APIs. Every command you run in the terminal is translated into an underlying REST API call to AWS endpoints.
- Unified Tool: Instead of downloading separate tools for S3, EC2, or ECS, you use a single executable _aws_ to interact with all services.
- Version 2 (v2): The current major version, which includes features like improved installers, interactive features, and support for AWS Single Sign-On (SSO).
