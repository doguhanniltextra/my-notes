[[Athena Performance & Cost Optimization]]

- IAM Policies: You can control which IAM roles have permission to query specific database or tables.
- Encryption: Athena can query encrypted data in S3 and encrypt the result of the queries using AWS KMS.
- Workgroups: You can create separate workgroups for different departments to isolate query history and set _data scan limits_ to prevent unexpected costs.
