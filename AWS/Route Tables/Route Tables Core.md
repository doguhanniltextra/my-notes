In the AWS ecosystem, a Route Table is a set of rules, called _routes_, that are used to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed. Route table is a _traffic controller_ of your VPC, ensuring that data rom your ECS (or other services) can reach the gateways (or the things that you want to reach).
