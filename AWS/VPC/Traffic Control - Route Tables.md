[[Connectivity Gateways]]

Route tables contain a set of rules that determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.
- Main Route Table: The default table for the VPC.
- Custom Route Tables: You create these for your public and private subnets to control precisely how traffic flows.
