End systems access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs), including residential ISPs such as local cable or telephone companies; corporate ISPs; university, ISPs; and ISPs that provide WiFi access in airports, hotels, coffee, shops, and other public places. Each ISP is in itself a network of packet switches and communication links. ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the end systems, including residential broadband access such as cable modem or DSL high-speed local area network access, wireless access, and 56 kbps dial-up modem access. ISPs also provide Internet access to content providers, connection Web sites directly to the Internet. 

The Internet is all about connecting end systems to each other, so the ISPs that provide access to end systems must also be interconnected.
